# Lesson 13: PCA

Principal Component Analysis(PCA) creates a new coordinate system using translation and rotation of axes. It moves origin of coordinate
system to the `center` of data. PCA then places `x-axis` along the direction with most variation relative to all the data points. 
`y-axis` is then placed in the orthogonal direction.

PCA also returns a `spread` value for the axis. Spread value tends to be large for x-axis as compared to y-axis.

Axis is said to `dominate` when spread in one axis much larger than spread in other axis.
 
`Latent` features contain most amount of information and are the driving force behind `measurable` features.
