# Lesson 6: Datasets and Questions

## Accuracy vs Training Set Size
`More Data > Fine-tuned Algo`

The max accuracy we can achieve is less than 90%. As we add more data the percentage of accuracy increases in large steps initially.
At later stages adding more data does not increase accuracy by leaps and bound. There is only a minor increase and then accuracy
starts plateauing.

## Types of Data
* Numerical: Like numbers
* Categorical: Limited number of discrete values(categoty)
* Time Series: Temporal Value(date, timestamp)
* Text: Words

## Note:
When generating or augmenting a dataset, you should be exceptionally careful if your data are coming from different sources for different classes. It can easily lead to the type of bias or mistake.
