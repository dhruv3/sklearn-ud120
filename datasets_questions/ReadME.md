# Lesson 6: Datasets and Questions

## Accuracy vs Training Set Size
`More Data > Fine-tuned Algo`

The max accuracy we can achieve is less than 90%. As we add more data the percentage of accuracy increases in large steps initially.
At later stages adding more data does not increase accuracy by leaps and bound. There is only a minor increase and then accuracy
starts plateauing.
